# Collaborative GitHub Workflow Project

This project demonstrates a collaborative workflow using GitHub with multiple branches (`main`, `dev`, `feature`).  
It includes creating feature branches, making changes, and using pull requests to merge code.

## Steps:

1. Create and work on a feature branch.  
2. Push changes and create a pull request to merge into `dev`.  
3. Review and merge the pull request.  
4. Merge `dev` into `main` branch.  
5. Run automated tests using GitHub Actions (`test.yml`) on merges.

This workflow helps teams collaborate efficiently and maintain code quality.
